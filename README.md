I think it can be updated with maybe 4x4 grid or a 5x5 grid for harder matchups and maybe even a grid within a grid for XO enthusiasts. Overal, I was proud of completing the project since I wasn't cofident in my abilities to make a game and in the near future I hope to expand on it to look better visually and be more engaging.

## About The Project

This project is a simple web-based implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows users to play against another human or against a basic computer opponent (using JavaScript's `Math.random()` for moves).

The game uses a clean and modern UI and updates the board dynamically as the game progresses.
